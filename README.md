# Keeper-Web-Application
This is a Keeper Web Application. It is clone of Google Keep. I have used ReactJs for building this project. ReactJS is really a powerful tool when it comes down making our Web Application more dynamic and more responsive. 
<br/>
I have come across some basic functions in ReactJS that can be really helpful while making our website more dyanmic:
<ul>
  <li>filter()</li>
  <li>map()</li>
  <li>reduce()</li>
</ul>
<br/>
All and all, it's really interseting to use ReactJs for the frontEnd development.

Right now I have just implemented this Web appplication using Array. Therfore all the content that one will write on this webpage will be gone once he/she will reload the page. I will be connecting to database in my next Versions of this project.
